## 3 things i want to try during this course

- Modern CSS animations
- For my groups app: RideMate (carpooling app) it would be benifitial to learn Google maps API because its the industry standard for geolocation and mapping .
- Another API to learn for RideMate would be Onfido api because varifying the identity of drivers is crucial for security in RideMate and learning Onfido will be great for document varification and facial recognition.

## 2 things i learned today

- The process of going through documentation and following along and trying different things.
- I accedently created my repository without checking which file my terminal was is so i learned my lesson to always double check what directory i am in before i make any repo.

## 1 word for how i am feeling

- Tired
